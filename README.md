## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```plaintext
30-Days-Of-Code/
├── Day1/
│   ├── Solution.java    # Solution implemented in Java
├── Day2/
│   ├── Solution.py      # Solution implemented in Python
├── Day3/
│   ├── Solution.cpp     # Solution implemented in C++
└── ...
```

Each folder corresponds to a specific day of the challenge and includes the solution file, implemented in one or more programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, C++).
